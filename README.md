# ComposeApp

This repository contains a minimal single-activity Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app now includes two Gradle modules:

- `app` – the main Android application.
- `designsystem` – a library module providing custom composables used across the app.

The main screen displays a greeting button created using the design system.
